# Html-coding
Coding in html/sql 
This is meant to make a preveiw of what coding is to beginneners and show them the coding world. This right now has
HTML and SQL/sequal on it (sequal is spelled incorrectly). 
This can also be used by coding teachers (though it depends on what grade you're teaching) to teach their children/
students. All of this information is from khan acadamy, , and . This updates around once every day depending on things
(every day on most weeks, maybe not on holiday and weekends, maybe not on breaks as in spring, summer, fall, and winter breaks
, maybe not on some weekdays).
