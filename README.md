# Html-coding
Coding in html/sql 
This is meant to make a preveiw of what coding is to beginneners and show them the coding world. This right now has
HTML and SQL/sequal on it (sequal is spelled incorrectly). 
This can also be used by coding teachers (though it depends on what grade you're teaching) to teach their children/
students. All of this information is from khan acadamy.
